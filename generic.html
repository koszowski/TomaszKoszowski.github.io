									<p align="justify">I am master of civil engineering and for last six years I've been working on construction site, recently as manager. After several years in this industry, I realized that I was more interested in analyzing data and using it to make informed decisions. I made the decision to transition to become a data analyst and pursued additional education in statistics and programming. I began my data journey approximately 10 months ago, undertaking various courses on popular online learning platforms such as DataCamp, Udemy and YouTube to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge.  <br /> As a civil engineer working as a construction manager, I gained experience in overseeing construction projects, managing budgets, and ensuring that safety standards were met. With my background in engineering and project management, I am well-equipped to translate complex data into actionable insights that can inform business decisions.   <br /> 
								I was also math tutor and spent many years helping students master complex mathematical concepts. I am able to break down difficult problems into manageable parts and explain them in easy way. I have solid mathematical background which might useful for a Data Analyst.  <br /> 
								One year ago I was just thinking about changing something with my career and since then I was able to learn a lot of things doing it after my full-time job. I am open to consider any position to gain esential experience and I am looking forward to learn much more.</p>
